# IP-Status-Checker
This is a simple IP status checker web application written in PHP. It sends ICMP echo requests (pings) to IP addresses and displays either a green or red circle next to each IP address based on the ICMP echo reply. It performs a similar check to websites by sending an HTTP request and checking if the response code is equal to 200.
